üèè Cricket Best 11 - Power BI Analysis

Welcome to the Cricket Best 11 project!
This repository contains a detailed data analysis of cricket players to identify and select the ultimate playing XI based on various performance parameters.
The project leverages Power BI for data visualization and decision-making.

üìä Key Highlights

Role-Based Analysis:
Players were analyzed based on their playing roles (All-Rounders, Anchors, Finishers, Power Hitters).

Parameter Scoping:
Each role had different evaluation parameters such as Strike Rate, Average, Consistency, Wickets, Economy Rate, etc.

Data-Driven Team Selection:
Final Playing 11 was selected purely based on performance metrics and visualization insights.

Power BI Dashboards:
Interactive and easy-to-understand dashboards were created to present the player evaluations and team selection.
