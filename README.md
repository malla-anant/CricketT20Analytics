🏏 Cricket Best 11 - Power BI Analysis

Welcome to the Cricket Best 11 project!
This repository presents a comprehensive Power BI data analysis of cricket players to identify and select the ultimate playing XI based on role-specific performance metrics.

📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a data-driven model that identifies the best cricket team possible — “The Best 11 from this Planet” — capable of:

Scoring 180+ runs on average.

Defending 150 runs consistently.

All selections were made purely using data analytics and Power BI visualizations — no personal bias, only performance.

🧩 Role-Based Analysis

Players were classified and analyzed by their primary roles, each having different evaluation criteria:

Role	Key Evaluation Parameters
Openers	Batting Average, Strike Rate, Boundary %, Batting Position
Anchors / Middle Order	Batting Average, Strike Rate, Average Balls Faced
Finishers / Lower Order Anchors	Batting Average, Strike Rate, Batting Position, Bowling Innings
All-Rounders	Batting Average, Strike Rate, Bowling Economy, Bowling Strike Rate
Specialist Fast Bowlers	Bowling Economy, Bowling Average, Strike Rate, Dot Ball %
